Whether it is my years of working in sustainability and recycling, or just a hate of things being wasted in general, I do seem to collect and hoard all the offcuts and scraps from any sewing project.  This does mean that the sewing cupboard is full to bursting of boxes of fabric scraps that I really need to do something with!  I’ve got some ideas to use bits and pieces in cushions (both as a patchwork cover but also as cushion stuffing) but today’s blog is about a special dress.
</p><br>
<p>
This is not just “a” special dress, but linked to “the” special dress for Carolyn (from my earlier <a href=http://www.johaydukdesigns.co.uk/2016/11/28/Carolyn_Dress.html > blog</a>).

When Carolyn and Jamie got married, Carolyn was 6 months pregnant (cue changes needed to the original design!).  When their daughter, Charlotte, was born 3 months later, I knew that I wanted to make a mini version of Carolyn’s wedding dress for Charlotte to enjoy.

I found a simple child’s dress commercial pattern which I could adapt to have the split overskirt that was a feature of Carolyn’s dress.  I also decided to go with a dress with straps, rather than sleeves to make is more practical for running around in the summer.

The challenge of using up leftover fabric is similar to using recycled fabrics – you don’t always have enough fabric to cut everything out, or you end up having to use less-than-perfect fabric (the cotton had several marks from the natural weave that looked like dirty smudges!).   This is one of the reasons why the straps ended up in the green bamboo silk rather than the organic cotton, but I think the dress looks better for it.  I fortunately had just enough lace trim to add to the dress, and created a Suffolk-puff badge to lift the finish it off.  The little badge actually ended up being a nod to the crochet flowers that finished off Carolyn’s dress.

In fact, I really love the end result, and I think Charlotte does too!

As Charlotte has since been joined by a younger sister, this means that the dress will be worn and loved again
