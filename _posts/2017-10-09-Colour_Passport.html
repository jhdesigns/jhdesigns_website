Have you ever noticed how some colours you wear can make you look healthy and happy whilst others make you look like you’ve had a rough night even if you’ve had 8 hours of sleep?  It is down to the colour of the garment and when you know your “colours” then you have a passport for effortless glow!
</p><br><p>
Now I don’t mean whether blue or red or green suits you best, it is down to the particular tint and shade.  There is a red out there to suit everyone but the tint that makes you look your best might make me look like I’m living under a cloud.
</p><br><p>
I had my “colours done” with <a href=https://www.houseofcolour.co.uk/ > House of Colour </a> about 6 years ago and now rave about it – so please forgive me!   The initial cost may feel high but it arms you with the knowledge to avoid making costly clothing mistakes in the future (so you could argue that it saves you money!).  
</p><br><p>
The colour analysis uses your skintone to identify which colour palette enhances your natural colourings.  The analysis first identifies whether your skintone suits a blue-based palette, or a yellow-based palette.  A blue-based palette skintone makes silver jewellery look amazing and expensive on you, whilst a yellow-based palette does the same for gold.  Once this has been figured out, the analysis moves on to show where on the blue-based or yellow-based spectrum you sit.  The blue-based spectrum is split into Summer and Winter.  For yellow-based this is Spring and Autumn.

Each colour on your palette is then given a rating for you.  Just because you are assigned a season doesn’t mean that you suit every colour on that palette.  For example, there is a neutral stone colour on my Winter palette that just looks awful on me (middle colour below)!  I know though that if I was to wear one colour from head to toe, then my best colours are navy, fuchsia (bottom colour below – though the camera has made it look more red than pink!), carmine and chinese blue.

In fact, the Keble dress features both the carmine and navy!

Once you know your colours, the first thing you do is go home and stare at your wardrobe.  This can be a bit daunting (and depressing) but you will notice some clothing gems in your colour palette and then it dawns on you why you look great wearing it!  My Mum is an Autum and one of the treasures in her wardrobe was a fabulous paprika coloured suit.  Of course there will be plenty of colours in your existing wardrobe that are no where near your optimum.  But fear not, if the garment is made from a natural fabric (cotton, linen, silk) then the fun starts with dye!  I had a cream jacket with sublte white embroidery.  As a Winter, the cream just drained the brightness from my face.  So, armed with a pack of bright red dye, the jacket went in the washing machine and was transformed.  The white embroidery was from a polyester thread and didn’t take the dye but the contrast was fabuous.

Alternatively, if you have an item of clothing that you really love, and want it in a different colour then Jo Hayduk Designs can help to make this happen!

So, I am a Winter and my Mum is an Autumn.  My oldest friend is a Spring, and her Mum is a Summer.  This means that when we go shopping, someone will come away with a great purchase. To make shopping that bit simpler, some companies like  <a href=https://www.kettlewellcolours.co.uk/ > Kettlewell </a> will even tell you the season for each garment they sell – easy!  
</p><br><p>
Talking to friends and clients who have had their colours done, the overiding message is the confidence that knowing the colour of the clothes they wear now makes them look their best, and how much easier it is to go shopping.  It’s this confidence that gave me the drive to move away from traditional ivory for my wedding dress, and leap into the Winter silvers and ice blues – and I’m so glad I did!
