I realise that I’m a bit late to the party when it comes to New Year Resolutions!  It might sound like a cop-out but this year I’m thinking of aspirations for the year rather than resolutions to be enforced straight after the excesses of Christmas.  
</p><br><p>
Before Christmas, I had a thorough sort out of my wardrobe and drawers, sending bags of clothes that I no longer love and wear to charity.  Finding out about Marie Kondo’s KonMari art of folding was also a bit of a revelation and I can now see all the clothes I own! So my first aspiration for this year is rationalising my wardrobe to be more sustainable – fewer items but more outfits. I am guilty of wearing the same outfits over and over again so will make a concerted effort to mix-and-match more!

Where new acquisitions are desired,  then they should be from charity shops, or made from sustainable fabrics. There was a lot in the news, towards the end of last year (including <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/5a1a43b5-cbae-4a42-8271-48f53b63bd07>Stacey Dooley Investigates</a>), highlighting the damaging effect on the environment of our fast fashion and throwaway society.  I thought I was fairly familiar with the findings but I was shocked to learn of the chemical waste pollution from the fabric dyeing in Indonesia (and many other places besides). This felt like a wake-up call because it is from the fabric we buy to make clothes ourselves, not just the clothes we buy in the shops. So my second aspiration is that any personal sewing projects, and as many projects as I can for my clients, will use sustainable fabrics.
</p><br><p>
Over the last few decades, I seem to have amassed quite a hoard of fabrics.  Many were given to me but some I do remember falling in love and buying with a speculative project in mind.  Now most of these fabrics would not be classed as sustainable, but I feel a concerted effort to clear the hoard of fabrics would certainly reduce the buying of any new fabrics and stop any fabrics potentially getting wasted.  
</p><br><p>
I hate wasting even small scraps of fabric so have two rather large boxes full of scraps filling my cupboard.

<br><p>
I have finally admitted to myself that I’m not going to start patchworking to use up the scraps. Also, my original idea of using the scraps to fill a cushion would make it feel like a doorstop rather than a fluffy cushion!  So, my first personal project of the year is to make the pouf from <a href=https://closetcasepatterns.com/fabric-floor-pouf-free-sewing-pattern/> Closet Case Patterns</a>.
 </p><br><p>
The final apsirations are to try and keep my desk clear, and to keep up with the blogs…

Happy 2019 everyone!
