Whenever I’m not sewing or designing, I love to be outside.  I always find wonder in nature – whether it is a flock of starlings swirling through the sky, bees dancing around flowers, or the fascinating shapes created by plants.  Just getting outside to breathe the fresh air and hear the bird song is guaranteed to lift my spirits.

One day, I would love to have a sewing studio in the garden and be surrounded by the beauty and energy of nature.  However, until that time, I would like share the lovely things that I find in my garden throughout the year – sometimes they help to spark new designs…

Last Saturday was one of those crisp, bright days towards the end of winter where the garden gives you little reminders that at least elements of it have survived the freezing winds and the rain.  Tucked among the stems of last year’s sedum, fresh buds were poking through as a wonderful contrast to the orange and brown around them. In fact, I think those colours may appear on my next head scarf or obi belt for New Once Worn.

This is definitely the time of year for helabores to shine, snow drops to show off their elegance and for the promise of more colour to come as the daffoldils push out of the ground.
