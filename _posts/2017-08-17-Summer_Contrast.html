This summer feels like it has been full of contrasts with the weather.  Muggy nights one week and then chilly mornings the next (the type of morning where you regret not shutting the greenhouse the previous evening).  Heatwave at the end of June and then autumnal torrential rain in August (with muddled weather for the whole of July).  It was on one of the rainy August days when I looked out the window from my sewing machine and felt that summer had already passed us by.  Determined not to feel glum, I put on my waterproofs and ventured out into the garden, hoping to feel restored by it.  I was not disappointed!

Even with the soggy weather, I was struck at how effective nature can be at brightening up the grey, and how it is impossible not to feel better from it.  It’s the contrasts provided by the plants which keeps me refreshed and provides lots of design inspiration.  I hope you will forgive a few plant examples…

This hydrangea sits in a very shady corner of the garden but doesn’t stop it glowing against the dark foliage:

I love the contrast of the clematis montana leaves against the pebbledash of the house.  There is also something about the contrast between the straight, silver, man-made wire, and the natural curves and colour of the stem which I find really intriguing and I’m sure will feature in a design in the future…

This sedum in bud offers contrasts of colour (green and white) but also of texture with the spray of tiny round buds against the large, fleshy, serrated leaves.  The glisten of the rain drops add an extra texture dimension:

Another texture and colour contrast is the hymalayan honeysuckle adding interest to a very shady corner:

And finally, the promise of contrast to come…

Right, back to the sewing table!
