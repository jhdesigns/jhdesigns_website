This year’s winter hibernation seems to have been longer than usual with the late snow, but at last, spring and summer have launched themselves upon us (almost at the same time)!  Daffodils, tulips and bluebells signal this change on the ground, but for me, the real burst of spring is felt when the blossom fills the trees.

Now I don’t pretend to know the different varieties of cherry, apple and magnolia that are responsible for the amazing display, but I do know that my walk through the village is all the richer for it.

I have been wanting to capture the spring blossom and flowers in my designs and have been starting to investigate the way to do this.  I’m hoping to be able to look at different approaches over the year, whether this is the use of flower shapes and colours in clothing design, or to be more literal and use flower motifs as surface decoration.  My next blog will focus on the latter as I’ve been experimenting with block printing.  Here’s a sneak preview!
