Now there may be frost on the ground as I write this, but spring is definitely here!  We’ve had some fabuously warm and sunny days in April which could make you think that we’ve skipped a season and landed straight in summer, but the reassuring changability of April has appeared to say that the best of summer is yet to come.
</p><br><p>
I must admit that the warmth of the sunshine has tempted me from my sewing table recently to capture some wonderful spring colour.  As much as I love seeing the green of the potato plants peeping through the brown of the earth, April for me has been overwhelmingly pink!  Most of the pink flowers currently in the garden are on the vibrant side, but let’s start with this lovely pale pink clematis montana.

This is its second year for this clematis in the pot by the wall and it seems to be getting happier each year.  Gardening does try to teach me patience - some plants just need a few years before they start to thrive.  Of course some just conk out, but others that look really desperate when they go in the ground can really surprise and get stronger each year.  This does mean that some are really now in the wrong place…

Tulips on the other hand tend to look amazing in their first season.  Bunkers Hill, my local plant nursery, had a display that was like pick-and-mix for gardeners – even down to the paper bag for your sweets (okay, bulbs).  It was the end of the season so most varieties had sold out, but it still took me ages to decide which ones to go for.  Anyway, I’m rather chuffed with all the ones I got though I do apologise for forgetting their names…

My final pink plant of the month is this dicentra.  The poor plant has been in a pot for the last 18 months waiting for a new flower bed but it is still hanging in there and looking serene.

I would like to start incorporating the shape and colour in some designs.  I’ve experimented with fabric printing and think it could look good as a feature on a collar or cuff.

With moving into a new month, the garden will be moving from pink and into purple.  The alliums are about to burst into life (if the slugs leave them alone) and the irises are keen to hog the limelight too – I can’t wait!

However, all this talk of pink has seen me delve into my fabric store and pull out a vibrant pink heavy-weight cotton – just right for a spring-into-summer dress.  The pink fuchsias should be out by the time I’ve made it which should match nicely!
