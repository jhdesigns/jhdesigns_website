With spring finally here I thought I would share with you a project from a spring wedding. This is a commission from last year for a dress that is perfect for little ones at a wedding.  For this dress, I have combined two things that I’m really interested in at the moment – upcycling and printing.
</p><br><p>
The brief for the dress was for it to be suitable for a 5 month old baby girl, and look lovely!  Having not made clothes for someone that small before (a three year old was the smallest I’d done <a href=http://www.johaydukdesigns.co.uk/2017/07/03/Mini_me.html > before</a>), the best place to start was with a commercial pattern.
</p><br><p>
I had quite a clear picture in my mind of how I wanted it to look – printing on a light coloured dress around the neckline and hem, with a belt, underskirt and sleeves in a colour to match the printing and bring the outfit together.  
</p><br><p>
One benefit of making clothes for someone so little is that the fabric requirement is small!  This makes it much easier to find the fabric in old clothes to be upcycled.  A white polycotton shirt was in need of a transformation so this was the fabric chosen.  A blue checked shirt was also on the upcycling pile so this was used for the lining.  The fabric for the underskirt, belt and sleeves was a satin-backed crepe from an 18 year old scarf.  The richness of the colour and fabric helped to lift the dress from everyday wear to something lovely for a wedding.

Next, on to the printing…  As you may have seen in previous blogs, I have been rather inspired by all the beautiful flowers around at the moment.  I chose flower shapes that I thought would translate well onto rubber printing blocks and carved them using a lino chisel. I experimented with the printing on paper and fabric to get the colour combinations that I thought would work best before starting on the real thing!

I cut out all the pattern pieces before printing and then built up the printing, leaving the seam allowances blank.

All that was left was to add some sequins and then assemble the dress!  I was hugely pleased with the result and the dress worked perfectly with a warm purple cardigan for a chilly March day.
