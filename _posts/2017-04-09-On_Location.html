I really loved the “studio” shots of the Keble dress (“studio” = friend’s dining room with lovely dogs who were keen to be involved) but I was keen to get some photos of the dress in its natural setting of Keble College in Oxford.
</p><br><p>
Keble was built in 1870 and is somewhat of a departure from the honey-coloured stone of the dreaming spires that are commonly associated with Oxford.  Keble was designed by William Butterfield and is made of brick.  The walls are not just a sea of red however, as white and blue bricks are used to create incredible geometric patterns.  So, you can see where the red, blue and white from the scarf comes from…  
</p><br><p>
Then, if you step inside the chapel, the theme of colour intensifies with vivid mosaics illuminating from the walls.  It can stop you in your tracks!
</p><br><p>
I appreciate that neo-gothic architecture is not everyone’s cup of tea, but if you get to visit Keble on a sunny day, it really is a magnificent picture.
</p><br><p>
Luckily, the day we chose for taking photos was one such sunny day…
