Having a birthday on the 30th December can be a bit naff – combined presents, partied out from Christmas etc.  But, when it comes for having a themed 30th birthday party on the 30th December, the theme was obvious – the Thirties!  
</p><br><p>
The 1930s is an era that I have always loved for fashion, art, design and music.  In fact, I remember loving the opportunity many years ago to do the costumes for my school sixth form production of A Merchant of Venice set in 1930s Italy.  Cue lovely long bias-cut dresses for Portia, Nerissa and Jessica… (though apologies to the actors that the dresses were made from cheap lining fabric rather than the beautiful silk they deserved!).
</p><br><p>
So, for me, when I think of 1930s evening wear, I think floor length skirts and dresses, bias cut satin, bold necklines and beautiful detailing.  The challenge was to encapsulate as much of that as I could in an outfit.  I thought that a skirt and top would be more versatile than a dress and I already had some fabulous navy shoes and silver handbag.  The colours (navy and silver) were therefore already decided!

For the skirt, I went for an elegant long straight style.  Instead of pain darts on the back, I decided to go for triangular panels near the waistband incorporating the darts into the seamlines. I felt this subtly added to the elegance of the design.

I wanted the top to be more striking and Art Deco inspired with bold lines.  Choosing a satin-backed crepe meant that I could use both the satin and the matt sides of the fabric to add contrast. The upper bodice panel and the central back panel were matt whilst the lower bodice panels, collar and armhole binding were sewn with the satin side up. Adding some hand-beaded detail both front and back lifted the design and made it sparkle.  The top had an invisible side zip and popper closure at the neckline.

Party day may have been greeted with typical wet December weather, but the rain certainly didn’t dampen the party atmosphere!  Everyone made a fantastic effort with their outfits and looked amazing.  There were 1930s servants, Biggles the pilot, look-a-like Bertie Woosters and glamorous ladies all round (not forgetting my Dad and brother with matching slick-backed hair…)  Sadly I don’t have any photographic evidence except for a pre-party shot of me (complete with Christmas tree!)

My party was a few years ago now but the outfit has made several appearances since then either complete (James Bond themed work Christmas do) or as separates – the top looks fab with jeans and the skirt is ultra-feminine when worn with a cosy jumper.  In fact, it did make an appearance for Christmas last month!
