<p>What can be better than having a favourite piece of clothing waiting in the wardrobe when you open it?  Answer - having a second one in a different colour and fabric! One recent commission was to do exactly that.  Rosemary had a fabulous, vibrant cotton tunic and asked if I could make another one.  I jumped at the opportunity as I love making clothes that I know will become a favourite.
</p><br><p>
We started off by looking at the fit of the original; figuring out if any changes would be needed.  We decided that increasing the vents at the side would just add to the comfort but everything else was to stay the same.  I then created the paper pattern from the original and made a toile (mock up) so we could check the fit.  I’m keen where possible to use recycled fabrics in the toile.  Where the toile only requires minimal changes then we effectively get two garments from the process which is an added bonus!
</p><br><p>
I raided my upcycling fabrics and found a large turquoise silk bridesmaid dress.

Rosemary immediately loved the vibrant colour so we knew we were on to a winner.  One of the drawbacks of using recycled fabrics is that there is not always a single large enough piece of fabric to fit the whole pattern piece on.  This meant that I had to create a bottom panel to both the front and back of the tunic.  The seam line for this panel could at any time be turned into a design feature by embellishing it with ribbons, sequins or buttons but we decided to leave it plain for now.
</p><br><p>
The fit matched the original really well.  This only left the important decision on the colour of the buttons.  I raided my button jar to find some options but ultimately we decided to go with buttons covered with some scraps of silver satin.  The contrast of the silver satin against the turquoise silk just makes the design sing and we both loved them!

So out of the process we have a beautiful silk tunic and a pattern so that we can make another one once we find some more fabric.  Finding some fabric to beat the turquoise silk though will be a challenge…

<h3> Rosemary's thoughts </h3>
<p>
"Jo made me a beautiful teal silk tunic  for me to wear over trousers.   I especially like the big silver-grey buttons that she suggested to finish off the garment.  It fits really well and I love the fact she took the material from a bridesmaid's dress she found in a charity shop! She also suggested more detail that can be added to the garment later.  I like this idea, as I've enjoyed wearing it quite plain with just the contrasting buttons, but I have the option to return to add further detailed work to the tunic.   I will definitely be asking Jo to make more items!"
