I’m sure I don’t need to remind you that we’re getting to the end of the year!  This means two things, the first is that Christmas is almost upon us (eek!) and second that it has been just over a year since <a href=https://www.johaydukdesigns.co.uk/ > Jo Hayduk Designs </a> went live!
</p><br><p>
I thought I would take this opportunity to look back over the year and share some memorable alteration highlights.  Some of my dressmaking highlights have already made blogposts of their own so I thought this review should focus just on alterations.  Firstly, having been an analyst in a previous job, I couldn’t resist breaking down the alteration jobs into percentages!
</p><br><p>
39% - trouser and jean shortening
19% - dress or skirt shortening
15% - reshaping (including armhole reduction)
16% - repairs
11% - other (there always has to be an “other” category!)
</p><br><p>
Here are some of my memorable alteration tasks:
</p><br>
<h3> Garment that made me smile</h3><p>
The wonderful boutique Nellie and Dove (link) had some really quirky dresses and tops with a really fun bird print on them.  Whenever there was an alteration needed on these outfits, the bird just made me smile!

<h3> Working with a quality garment </h3><p>
I was asked to shorten 2 pairs of Paul Smith trousers and the quality of the fabric and construction really stood out.  It is lovely to work with fabric that behaves itself!
</p><br>
<h3> Trickiest fabric/garment</h3><p>
There are many that are contending for this title, but the one that really sticks in my mind is a pair of turquoise silk trousers.  Don’t get me wrong, they were stunning and would feel amazing to wear, but trying to shorten and shape the hems was a huge challenge!  We wanted to shape the hem to show off the fabulous shoes that finished off the outfit, but slippery silk made getting both hems to match perfectly a particular challenge!
</p><br>
<h3> Unusual approach</h3><p>
This was for possibly my youngest client!  The zip head was broken on a 5-year old’s Star Wars Bag and therefore needed to be replaced.  The bag itself was so stiff that trying to get it under the sewing machine needed the help of the Force (or a pile of books…!)

<br>
<h3> Something different…</h3><p>
I like to think that I’m someone who relishes a challenge and two alteration jobs certainly ticked this box.  The first was to replace a zip in a Kevlar fencing training jacket.  I was certainly up for the challenge, but was my sewing machine?!  With extra heavy duty thread and needles, the replacement was duly carried out (with a bit of creative problem solving required as there was no way that the needle would get through 2 layers of Kevlar) and the training jacket had another lease of life!
</p><br><p>
The second challenge was the kilt repair.  Having grown up in Cornwall, kilts were certainly not uncommon.  In fact, I wore my first Cornish kilt at the age of 8 to dance a Cornish broom dance but at that age didn’t really look at the kilt’s construction!  The kilt that needed repairing had been well loved and well used for Scottish dancing.  Many of the pleats, belt loops and even some seams were coming undone.  Studying the construction of the kilt highlighted that it was handmade and therefore several hours of hand-sewing followed to bring the kilt up to glory again with one very happy customer:
</p><br><p>
 “I must thank you so very much for such a splendid job on my kilt: it did so badly need it, and each stitch of yours in time saves not 9 but, given the sheer weight of cloth, perhaps 99999!   Anyway, many many thanks for a lovely job.”

<br><p> 
So, I’m looking forward to seeing the challenges that come up over the next year but possibly starting by having a break over the festive period!
</p><br><p>
Wishing you all a Happy Christmas and joyous New Year!
