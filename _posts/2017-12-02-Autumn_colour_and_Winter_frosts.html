The ground is carpeted in a wonderful display of oranges, reds and browns, and there is certainly now a chill all around.  It can only mean one thing, that Autumn is passing the baton across to Winter to see us through the rest of the year.  But before we feel too gloomy about the short days and cold winds, there is a lot of beauty to admire and inspire outside.

Ever since I made the woven panel on my wedding dress (<a href=http://www.johaydukdesigns.co.uk/2016/12/02/Jo_Dress.html > here</a>), I have loved seeing the effect that comes from weaving ribbons.  I have lots of ideas of where this design element can feature but have started off by making some obi-belts.  Obi-belts, or sash belts, are hugely versatile and can be used to complete an outfit, either by effectively joining two separates, or by breaking up a single-colour outfit.  Google Images and Pinterest are awash with the many ways that an outfit can be styled with these fabulous belts.  Here are some plain obi-belts that I’ve made in the past:

Anyway, back to the weaving!  I’m a bit of a horder when it comes to ribbons (I even keep the little bits of ribbon that are tied onto Christmas crackers…) so I delved into my ribbon boxes to find ribbons of colour themes that I liked.  As you may have guessed by the title of the blog, two of those themes were autumn leaves and winter frosts!
</p><br><p>
Having gathered my ribbons and cut out a backing fabric, the fun then starts with arranging the ribbons…

<br>

<br><p> 
The ribbons are machine sewn to the backing fabric around the edge of the belt, but all the joins between the woven ribbons are hand-sewn to hide the stitching.
</p><br><p>
Each of the belts has a non-woven reverse side so that there are even more options for wearing it.

<br><p> 
Unlike the plainer belts featured at the top of this blog, these woven belts have a separate tie (attached to the belt through belt loops) as this again provides more flexibility.  You could use a longer or shorter tie depending on the final look you would like to achieve.

So, which colour themes should I try next?!
