<p>
When my friend, Clare, asked if I could make another version of a favourite dress, I was immediately drawn to the style of dress and the possibilities with it.  The dress was knee-length, with a v-neck, belt at the waist and kimono style sleeves (the sleeves were part of the pattern for the body of the dress rather than being sewn on separately).  It was a dress that didn’t look all that much on the hanger but once you put it on, it just looked really flattering and relaxed.
</p><br><p>
Clare wanted a version of the dress that could be worn to a wedding in December.  I started off by making a toille to check the fit and then we started to think about fabrics and colours.  This one pattern very efficiently ended up creating 4 dresses for 2 people over the course of 6 months!
</p><br><p>
The original dress pattern was made from 5 pattern pieces, dress front (with sleeve), dress back (with sleeve), front facing, back facing and belt.  The front pieces were joined by a seam down the centre.  The side seams and shoulder seams created the sleeves.  Here are the adaptations:
</p><br><p>
<h3> Dress 1 – geometric drape </h3><p>
Fabric choice: grey and white geometric pattern on a synthetic satin. Unlined.
</p><br><p>
Style adaptations: the fabric came from Malaysia and there wasn’t quite enough on which to fit the full pattern, so the sleeves and dress length were shortened.  
</p><br>

<br><p> 
End use and style: the lovely drape quality of the fabric makes the dress really easy to wear and works really well with a contrasting belt.  Great for wearing to go shopping, and also out for an evening when worn with a bolero or jacket.  Initially there was quite a build up of static in the dress so it rather clung to you, but this has eased over time. 
</p><br><p>
<h3> Dress 2 – summer party </h3><p>
Fabric choice: green sari silk with dark green polyester lining
</p><br><p>
Style adaptations: The width of the silk defined how long the sleeve could be.  As Clare wanted the sleeves a little longer, we added a cuff to the dress which used the richly embroidered part of the sari.  The belt was also made from this part of the fabric to provide a contrast.  By removing the seam in the front of the dress (placing the pattern piece on the fold instead) we were able to add another fraction to the sleeve length.  This also gave a cleaner finish to the front of the dress.  The nature of the sari silk is that it is very easy to catch the gold threads on the reverse of the fabric which unfortunately then distorts the face of the fabric.  To minimise the risk of this happening, the dress was lined (which also added to the luxury of the finished dress!) which meant that facings were not required.

<br><p> 
End use and style: Clare was nervous of the bold colour initially but it really suited her skin tone and she looks fabulous in it.  It has already been used for a summer wedding and has been thoroughly tested on the dance floor!  It will also work really well as a winter dress with thick tights and a pashmina wrap.
</p><br><p>
<h3> Dress 3 – summer maternity maxi </h3><p>
Fabric choice: bold, black and white patterned cotton.  Unlined.
</p><br><p>
Style adaptations: turning this pattern to a floor-length maxi dress required several pattern adaptations.  To provide room for walking, a godet was added to the back and an additional panel was added to the front which was pleated to sit under the original bust line measurement.  By adding the front pleats, the dress very effectively became suited to maternity wear too if needed.  The sleeves were shortened for summer use and the dress remained unlined to stay cool (and therefore used the facings from the original pattern).
</p><br>

<br><p>
End use and style: The floor length style was neatly balanced by the short sleeves which was especially needed when using such a bold pattern.  The contrasting belt (or blue scarf which has tended to be used) helps to break up the dress and looks really effective.  The dress can be easily dressed up (with a blue jacket) or down (with a black top to enhance the mono-chome look).  The only downside of the dress is that the fabric creases very easily…

<h3> Dress 4 – Winter Wedding </h3><p>
Fabric choice: silk devore floral patterned top layer with a satin under-layer.  
</p><br><p>
Style adaptations:  the style of this version has elements of the other three!  The front piece is cut on the fold (like dress 2) but the width of the fabric was sufficient to not need cuffs on the sleeves.  The choice of sheer dovore fabric for the dress meant that a satin under-layer was needed.  If we had then added a lining, the dress would have been too thick and therefore went went with the facings (dress 1 and 3) made out of the same satin under-layer fabric.  Working with the two layers of fabrics together certainly provided many challenges but I feel the final dress is really beautiful.

<br><p> 
End use and style: the devore silk was a very pretty fabric by itself, but adding the satin underneath lifted the dress to being something very special.  Using the satin for the belt really ties all the colours in together.  For the wedding, the dress will be teamed with either a soft pashmina, or a jacket – yet to be decided!  Oh, and of course there will be a hat…
