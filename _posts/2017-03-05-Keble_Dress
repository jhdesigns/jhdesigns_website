My first big upcycling challenge of 2017 has taken the form of an evening dress.  Granted, the number of black-tie events I go to now is pretty much zero, but there’s a nice story to the dress.
</p><br><p>
The starting garment was itself an evening dress.  I made it many years ago for university black-tie dinners.  It was made of a stiff red curtain silk fabric and adapted from a vogue Calvin Klein pattern.  Once my university days were behind me, I stored the dress away in tissue paper.  Frustratingly, the next time I came across the dress, patches of mould were starting to mark it.  So, into the washing machine it went.  Out of the washing machine it came, much softer, much shorter and having imparted its dye on everything else that was washed with it…  It was a bit of a disaster really so got relegated to my box of “things to use in a sewing project”.
</p><br><p>
Also in the box was my university scarf with the Keble College colours of red, white and blue.  The red matched really well with the ruined dress and I liked the contrast of textures from the rougher wool of the scarf to the beautiful gentleness of the silk.  I did consider turning it into cushions but I’ve frankly got loads of cushions already and besides, the dress still had quite a number of redeeming features that could be used again.  I also like the idea that a black-tie dress I wore to Keble College events could again become a Keble dress.

The washing machine incident had shrunk the silk lengthways but the bodice was still just about wearable.  I could have just shortened the dress and be done with it, but I wanted it to be more of a statement piece, incorporating as much fabric from the scarf as possible.  The dark blue from the scarf was a bold contrast to the red so I wanted that to feature at the back, keeping the front simpler.  There was only limited fabric available from the scarf so I couldn’t lengthen the dress all the way around.  Instead I opted to create an uneven hemline to make a feature of it.

Using recycled fabrics creates numerous challenges.  The original dress had a standard lapped zip but I wanted an invisible zip to give it a better finish.  However, the only recycled invisible zip I had available to use was skirt-length rather than dress-length.   I went with it because the seam with the zip starts low on the back and I thought would be okay. I could just about get the dress on (with some Houdini style wiggling) but following some more alterations to improve the fit, the short zip really made getting the dress on and off too difficult.  So, unfortunately a new zip was ultimately needed.  Also, using fabric from other garments means that you can often end up with previous stitching lines leaving holes in all the wrong places.  I think though that this adds to the story of the garment and therefore is no bad thing (same with the moth holes in the scarf that needed darning…)!
</p><br><p>
So, I’m pretty chuffed with the final garment and now just need a suitable event to premier wearing it!

If you would like to see the dress in the flesh, then it will be on display at ReFashion 2017 in Oxford Town Hall, 12-6pm on Saturday 11th March.
